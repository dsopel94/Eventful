		<h1>About me and this app</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is Damian Sopel and I am a 2015 UW-Madison graduate in Statistics though I am looking to transition into the 
			field of web development. This app is the first basic project I built for Thinkful, the web dev bootcamp from which 
			I initially learned how to program </p>
		<p>This application is relatively simple compared to others you may find in my portfolio as it was built when I first started out learning programming. It allows you to search for events going on in your area this week by city and keyword. The program makes an API call to Eventful's servers and returns search results. Only HTML, jQuery, and CSS were used to create this program
		</p>
